            `Every individual is unique and different, this what I believed until I started working for a multinational company from India. The moment I started working with UK clients without even meeting them, I felt that “us” feeling(just like experiment with babies and dolls - babies hated dolls who eats food that they don't like). I was always thinking from our side, considering even project managers from the client side as some weird set of people who is in the other side of the game. The single story portrayed by our history texts or Indian movies about the cruel things British people did to India. I still remember the day we had a call with British project manager for our first review, I was expecting a rude and unfriendly voice. Unexpectedly it was one of the friendliest phone calls I ever had in my life. The fact that how polite and friendly she was erased all the stereotypes I had back in my mind. The way she appreciated gave me goosebumps, even for the changes she said “it would be great if you can add this one too”. I would say the small talk and greetings can be considered as the Magic moment in our communication, right away I understood their rules of communication. The very first single experience proved the single story wrong; lemons and my lemon. Three years in my very first company in career changed my views on foreigners especially about the British. I was able to understand cultural standards; what all behaviors are “accepted and familiar”.`,
            `I reached Germany with more open mind and believing that I can get lot more intercultural experiences. The moment I know I am going to live with guys from Pakistan, I forgot everything I learned from my previous experiences. All through my childhood from newspapers and movies I have heard only the war or terrorism in Pakistan. All the Indian movies portray Pakistanis as Terrorists and enemies of India. Even the cricket match between India and Pakistan was considered like a war, which we all are supposed to pray for our victory. The day I met my flat mates (we shared the kitchen), I was like this is not the physical appearance I expected, “they are like us”, even share common food and culture. It was a real cultural shock to find them friendly, we had even common looks. We enjoyed cooking together, working in projects together. There may be conflicts in borders, but Indians and Pakistanis never wanted a war or don't even care to whom Kashmir belongs. I can reflect that we even have similar cultural standards.
In first few months in Germany, my only German contacts were one and only German student in our class and my Buddy whom I was introduced by Buddy program in the University. I have heard about cultural standards in Germany, Germans are punctual, very direct, independent, not trustable in relationship, and are set of people who go only with rules and do not have family bonds. I was surprised how dependent and attached my German friend is to her mom and also the fact that she doesn't even have a boyfriend; My lemon. Second person, my colleague was just opposite of my Buddy, he was so independent and cool. Lemons even from the same tree are unique.

            `Experiences as a pregnant student proved that Germans value family a lot, my professors used to ask me if I need any extension in submitting project, papers or even for exams. I can't even think of traveling via public transport while pregnant or with a baby in India, in Germany it was really comfortable and safe. How friendly the people in Germany are made me feel at home. Once baby was born, we moved to a private house, our landlady treats us like her children. And we even have contacts with all our neighbours I would say more than what we had back in India. Personal contacts and experiences can erase all the stereotypes or can complete incomplete stories about a culture.`,

            `Intercultural communication studies are on special significance with increasing number of global teams all over the world.
Intercultural communication means communication among people who are culturally different. So, to have successful
communication among people with different cultural background, we need to first analyze what does cultural difference
means. This again goes back to history of cultures, cultural differences and covers much more aspects than mere
communication. Successful intercultural communication requires special skills and understanding of different cultures.
Linguistic barrier even though is identified as basic challenge in intercultural communication, factors like cultural differences
in non-verbal communication, prejudices and stereotypes about different cultures affect communication of people who have
mastered the language.`,
            `One of the core aspect in intercultural communication is culture. Intercultural communication should primarily focus on
understanding differences between different cultures. “When in Rome be like Romans” is a famous saying that describes
importance of study of different cultures. Culture can be defined as how things are in a region or by a group of people. To
understand cultural differences is not simple as the definition says, as most of the things are revealed only when we have real
friends in that culture.`,
            `Software development teams are becoming more and more international. With the recent developments with free transfer
of services and service givers it’s hard to find a monocultural team any more. A lot of software development happens in
developing countries where the wages are relatively low. Which make it imperative that people of different cultural and
language background must play a big role in communicating with the client as well as the developers. Effect of cultural
differences in software development teams are always neglected when analyzing cost effective options for software
development. Understanding intercultural communication challenges and acquiring knowledge and skills for efficient
intercultural communication is very important to be a part of global teams. Knowing the fact that my team member is not like
me, he or she doesn’t think likes me, can help a lot in developing positive attitude towards differences and can help in
eradicating misunderstandings in communication. The knowledge one can attain from trainings or books about a different
culture is just a tip of ice burg, to have real knowledge about a new culture one should have personal experiences and true
friends of that culture.`,
